# Tractatori
A Story narrative designing tool for Unity providing the power of StablerCharacter workflow.

# Ability
It can do pretty much work, but mostly, cut down on hard-coded script like moving objects, story creation, and more. Everything inside a small container.

# Acknowledgement
This is the very first version of Tractatori, performance might be bad, code might be badly handled. And issues report are welcome.
